# Avoid Colorblindness Issues by Carefully Choosing Colors that Convey Information
## Exercise

There are various forms of colorblindness. These can range from a reduced sensitivity to a certain wavelength of light to the inability to see color at all. Steve suffers from the most common form, which is a reduced sensitivity to detect greens.

For example, if two similar green colors are the foreground and background color of your content, Steve may not be able to distinguish them. Close colors can be thought of as neighbors on the color wheel (Figure 1), and those combinations should be avoided when conveying important information.

- Steve struggles to read the button text, change the text `color` to e.g. a dark blue (`#003366`) on the yellow (`#FFFF33`) button

## Example

Example of a color choice that is difficult for a Green-Weak Deuteranomaly to read:
- Text `color`: 					`#33FF33`
- `background-color`: 		`#FFFF33`
