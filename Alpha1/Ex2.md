# Use Headings to Show Hierarchical Relationships of Content

When Peter uses his screen reader, he is able to get a summary of a web page by having it read only the headings. This means it is important structuring the HTML headers  (`h1`  through  `h6` ) to indicate what content the different sections contain and indicate the hierarchical relationships of your content. Headers also need to be in the right order and NOT skip a header rank. Headers should NOT be chosen based on its text size, this can be done with CSS.

If you were writing a paper with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion,  it wouldn't make much sense to put the conclusion as a subsection of the body in your outline, because Peter's screen reader would not tell him that there is a conclusion section. It should instead be its own section. Similarly, the heading tags in a webpage need to go in order and indicate the hierarchical relationships of your content. Figure 1 shows, on the left the correct order and on the right, the wrong order.

- Help Peter using the web site by fixing the HTML code, so the correct heading tags are used

Here are two examples of using the correct and wrong order of HTML heading tags

**Correct order:**
```html
<h1>Section</h1>
	<h2>Subsection1</h2>
		<h3>Subsubsection</h3>
	<h2>Subsection2</h2>
```
**Wronger order, where** `h3` **is skipped:**
```html
<h1>Section</h1>
	<h2>Subsection1</h2>
		<h4>Subsubsection</h4>
	<h2>Subsection2</h2>
```
